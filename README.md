# Three Language Axes

This chart naively visualizes three major things about programming languages.

### Type System

This is about how type safe it is, how unlikely compiled code will fail in runtime because of a wrong type passed/used.

### Runtime

This tells about how much of a job is on a language runtime. For simplicity I take the most common *implementation* of a language, because many modern languages can be compiled/interpreted/etc., used in different modes.

### Paradigm

This one goes from procedural to OOP to FP. This is about *how* you write your code, what patterns of logic you apply.
